We expect to get a graph that increases in time as the number of rows and columns n increases. 
You also should expect to see a sharp increase in time before the graph levels off again. 
This shosw you when the processors has ran out of RAM and began to reach into cache memory. 


On the 6-node cluster called LittleFe, this was around n = 400. 

Because of the "tyranny of storage hierarchy," we have to find away to utilize multiple 
nodes in a way that the matrix multiplication will be solved in components less than 400 by 400.

You can read more about the "tyranny of storage hierarchy" and tiling at the websites for Henry Neeman's weblecture
